This is the code for the GENAI project for SI644.

For part 1, I gave the model the script for the Bee Movie and asked it to identify all of the traits for different characters. It took a while to run, but eventually was successful.

For part 2, I connected the model to the Chinook database locally and asked it to identify the 'best song.' It conflated this with the UnitPrice and gave me the song with the highest UnitPrice.
